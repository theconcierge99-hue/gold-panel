Concierge Agent is **market intelligence + Concierge Resources + Security Desk as a service** for autonomous agents and builders. **24 pay-per-call routes** on `https://conc-exe.xyz` — settlement via **x402 USDC or TCX** ([PayAI facilitator](https://facilitator.payai.network) primary; [Dexter](https://x402.dexter.cash) fallback + [OpenDexter](https://dexter.cash/opendexter) discovery). Listed on [x402scan](https://www.x402scan.com/) and callable from [Poncho](https://tryponcho.com/) — **no Concierge API key**.

**Concierge AI** — natural-language desk (`POST /api/concierge`) for macro, geo, technicals, and trading plans.

**Research** — structured JSON for agent marketplaces: `intel-macro` (SPX, VIX, DXY, Fear & Greed, Treasury yields) and `intel-wire` (headline digest from RSS + Lounge memory).

**DeFi Intel** — structured JSON: TVL (DeFi Llama), yields (Meteora DLMM, Jupiter), whale positioning (Binance), wallet snapshots (Helius), desk verdict with optional Lounge insider overlay.

**Alpha Intel** — insider-first synthesis for airdrop candidates, exchange listing rumors, momentum scans, and scalp desk (5m/15m).

**Lounge** — unlock wire headlines and creator RWA signals.

**Security Desk** — passive authorized scans: unified `security-scan` ($0.10), scout `security-readiness` / `security-headers` ($0.02), free `security-scope`, free `conc-exe.xyz` self-audit (`selfAudit: true`). Docs: https://conc-exe.xyz/docs/api/security · skill `/skills/concierge-security/SKILL.md`.

Flow: `POST` + JSON → **402** + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` → sign USDC → retry with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` → **200** JSON (or HTML `reply` for chat).

x402 USDC payment accepted on Solana mainnet ($0.02–$0.25 per call; $0.02 security scout; $1.00 signal publish).

## Spend-aware usage

- Prefer **Intel routes** (`/api/concierge-intel-*`) when you need structured JSON for agent pipelines — cheaper than parsing HTML from chat.
- Use **`/api/concierge-intel-macro`** with `{}` for macro desk snapshots (Poncho research prompts).
- Use **`/api/concierge-intel-wire`** for headline digests — filter with `category` or `message`.
- Use **`/api/concierge-intel-tvl`** with `{}` for the cheapest DeFi snapshot.
- Use **`/api/concierge-intel-verdict`** once per theme instead of chaining whales + yields + chat separately.
- Alpha routes (`airdrop`, `listing`, `momentum`, `scalp`) weight Lounge insider signals first — set `includeInsider: true` (default) for best alpha quality.
- Cap `limit` on Alpha bodies to the smallest number that answers the task (1–8, default 5).
- For authorized security posture: scope check free, then `security-scan` ($0.10) or scout routes ($0.02). Always pass `allowlist` + `authorized: true`.
- Call from **server-side or agent runtime** — browser CORS is limited to the Lounge origin.
